# K-Means-Algorithm-on-Iris-Dataset
This repository contains the code for implementing the K-Means Algorithm on the famous Iris Dataset. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and it is used to demonstrate the working of various machine learning algorithms. In this repository, we are using the K-Means Algorithm to perform clustering on the Iris dataset.

The code is written in Python and is implemented in Jupyter Notebook. The code is well-documented and easy to understand. The repository contains two files:

- K\_Mean\_Lab\_Report.ipynb - This is the Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and the explanations for the implementation of the K-Means Algorithm on the Iris dataset.
- iris.csv - This is the Iris dataset file which contains the data to be used for the clustering.

## How to use

- To use this repository, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download Jupyter Notebook from here.
- Clone the repository on your local machine using the command git clone https://github.com/your-username/K-Means-Algorithm-on-Iris-Dataset.git
- Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the repository.
- Open the K\_Mean\_Lab\_Report.ipynb file and run the code.

## Results

The K-Means Algorithm on the Iris dataset produces the results in the form of clusters. The code visualizes the clusters using the scatter plot. The results can be used for further analysis and comparisons with other clustering algorithms.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of the K-Means Algorithm on the Iris dataset. The code is well-documented and easy to understand. This repository can be used as a reference for the implementation of the K-Means Algorithm on any other dataset.
